    <h1>ü•ê Croissant</h1>
    <p>
      A cousin of the croissant is the Italian cornetto (in the center and
      south) or brioche (in the north). These variants are often considered to
      be the same, but that is not completely true: the French version tends to
      be crispy, whereas an Italian cornetto or brioche is usually softer.
